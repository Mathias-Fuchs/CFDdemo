# CFDdemo
simple demonstration of CFD in 2d; adaptation of classical code by Nealen to modern fftw3


A fluid dynamics solver based on FFT.
From nealen.com/projects/algoanim/flowanim.cpp

Adapted to modern fftw by Mathias Fuchs

This program uses the fluid dynamics solver presented
in Jos Stam, "A Simple Fluid Solver Based on the FFT",
(dgp.utoronto.ca/people/stam/reality/Research/pub.html)
The initial codebase for this program was written by Gustav Taxen
and can be found on the internet at:
